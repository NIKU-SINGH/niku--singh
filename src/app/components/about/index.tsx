              on the internet. My interest in web development started back in
              2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns
              out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about
              HTML & CSS!

              Fast-forward to today, and I`&apos;`ve had the privilege of
              working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation,

              building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
              Statement for a variety of clients.
